        Apple has released headphones that simulate surround sound. By turning your head, the audio seems to change the location it comes from. I will do my best to replicate this feature. My final product will be used as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sync the connected HC-05 module to a
            computer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Plug in headphones to the Discoveryâ€™s
            headphone jack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Run a custom C++ script on the computer to
            send the wave file to the HC-05.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the Discovery Board with its
            accelerometer on your head.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rotate your head to experience the 3D sound.
        </li>
    </ol>
