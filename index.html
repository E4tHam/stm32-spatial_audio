    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Apple has released headphones that simulate surround sound. By turning your head, the audio seems to change the location it comes from. I will do my best to replicate this feature. My final product will be used as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sync the connected HC-05 module to a computer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Plug in headphones to the Discoveryâ€™s headphone jack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Run a custom C++ script on the computer to send the wave file to the HC-05.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the Discovery Board with its accelerometer on your head.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rotate your head to experience the 3D sound.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2.26 Update</h2>
    <p>
        This week, I found a library on GitHub so that I can send a UART signal through C++ code.
    </p>
    <a href="https://github.com/manashmandal/SerialPort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SerialPort - C++ Library for Serial Communication with following criteria</a>
    <p>
        Using this, I redid lab 4 part a.

        This weekend, I will send Wave file data instead of text. Over the week, I will solve the bounded buffer problem for incoming/playing samples.
