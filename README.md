## Description

Apple has released headphones that simulate surround sound. By turning your head, the audio seems to change the location it comes from. I will do my best to replicate this feature. My final product will be used as follows:

1. Sync the connected HC-05 module to a computer.
2. Plug in headphones to the Discoveryâ€™s headphone jack.
3. Run a custom C++ script on the computer to send the wave file to the HC-05.
4. Place the Discovery Board with its accelerometer on your head.
5. Rotate your head to experience the 3D sound.
